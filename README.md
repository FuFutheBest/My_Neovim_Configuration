# My_Neovim_Configuration

As we all know, Neovim is a highly customizable text editor. I have been using Neovim for a while now and I have customized it to my liking. I have added a lot of plugins and key mappings to make my workflow more efficient. I have also added a lot of custom settings to make the editor more user-friendly. In this blog post, I will share my Neovim configuration with you. I hope you find it useful.

Basically, my Neovim configuration is from a YouTuber's video [How I Setup Neovim To Make It AMAZING](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pAG3BHurdM&t=4217s). He is an amazing YouTuber and I have learned a lot from his videos. I have made some changes to his configuration to suit my needs since he is a web developer and I need more features for C/C++ development.

**Note**: In the video, since he is a Mac user, he uses `homebrew` as the package manager. If you are a Linux user, don't try to do the same thing (don't use `brew`). Otherwise, you will be in trouble later.

If you don't want to struggle with the video, you can just clone my repository and use my configuration. Put it under `~/.config/nvim/` and you are good to go. (Maybe you need a little knowledge of Neovim and the plugin manager `lazy.nvim` ([lazy.nvim repo](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)))

Below is the tree structure of my Neovim configuration:
